# Exercise:
Humans in Europe are expected to live ~81 years.  But they spend a lot that time sleeping--silly humans!
Make a list of how much sleep time each teammate needs to feel rested (per night), then multiply it by the European life expectancy
to get a list of Estimated Sleep Expectancies (in years).

What's the average ESE of your group?
